🍽️ AI-Based Chef App

Built with Gemini · Streamlit · Docker · Cloud Run
Developed as part of the GenAI Exchange Program - Challenge Lab
Personalized Recipe Generator using Google Gemini & Streamlit


## 🧠 Project Summary

This project was built as a Proof of Concept (POC) for Cymbal Health, a fictional healthcare network aiming to enhance Healthy Living & Wellness through smart nutrition advice. The idea was to create an AI-powered chef app that generates personalized meal plans and recipes using user preferences and dietary needs.

It uses Google’s Gemini multimodal model, the Streamlit web framework, and is deployed on Google Cloud Run via containerized Docker environments.


## 🏥 Challenge Scenario

As a new team member at Cymbal Health, your task was to design a customer-facing app to:
- Promote better nutrition
- Offer daily meal suggestions
- Respect food allergies and restrictions
- Suggest recipes based on available ingredients

You were provided a sandbox environment to build and deploy the solution using cutting-edge GenAI tools.


## ✅ Tasks Completed
- 🔍 Tested Gemini API with `cURL`
- 🧪 Wrote Streamlit app logic in `chef.py`
- 🐳 Created and customized the `Dockerfile`
- 📦 Pushed Docker image to Artifact Registry
- 🚀 Deployed the app to Google Cloud Run
- 🧪 Successfully tested deployment output
